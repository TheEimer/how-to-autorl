\section*{Checklist for Reinforcement Learning Research with Hyperparameter Optimization}

\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em 
    \item Are there training and test settings available on your chosen domains? \\ If yes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is only the training setting used for training? \cmark \xmark
        \item Is only the training setting used for tuning? \cmark \xmark
        \item Are final results reported on the test setting? \cmark \xmark
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hyperparameters were tuned using \texttt{$<$package-name$>$} which is based on \texttt{$<$an-optimization-method$>$}
    \item The configuration space was:
    \texttt{$<$algorithm-1$>$}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{$<$a-continuous-hyperparameter$>$}: (\texttt{$<$lower$>$}, \texttt{$<$upper$>$})
        \item \texttt{$<$a-logspaced-continuous-hyperparameter$>$}: log((\texttt{$<$lower$>$}, \texttt{$<$upper$>$}))
        \item \texttt{$<$a-discrete-hyperparameter$>$}: [\texttt{$<$lower$>$}, \texttt{$<$upper$>$}]
        \item \texttt{$<$a-categorical-hyperparameter$>$}: {\texttt{$<$choice-a$>$}, \texttt{$<$choice-b$>$}}
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \texttt{$<$algorithm-2$>$}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{$<$an-additional-hyperparameter$>$}: (\texttt{$<$lower$>$}, \texttt{$<$upper$>$})
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \item The search space contains the same hyperparameters and search ranges wherever algorithms share hyperparameters \cmark \xmark \\ If no, why not?
    \item The cost metric(s) optimized was/were \texttt{$<$a-cost-metric$>$}
    \item The tuning budget was \texttt{$<$the-budget$>$}
    \item The tuning budget was the same for all tuned methods \cmark \xmark \\ If no, why not?
    \item If the budget is given in time: the hardware used for all tuning runs is comparable \cmark \xmark
    \item All methods that were reported were tuned with this the methods and settings described above \cmark \xmark \\ If no, why not?
    \item Tuning was done across $<n>$ tuning seeds which were: [$<0>$, $<1>$, $<2>$, $<3>$, $<4>$]
    \item Testing was done across $<m>$ test seeds which were: [$<5>$, $<6>$, $<7>$, $<8>$, $<9>$]
    \item Are all results reported on the test seeds? \cmark \xmark \\ If no, why not?
    \item The final incumbent configurations reported were: \\ \texttt{$<$algorithm-1-env-1$>$}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{$<$a-hyperparameter$>$}: \texttt{$<$value$>$}
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \texttt{$<$algorithm-1-env-2$>$}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{$<$a-hyperparameter$>$}: \texttt{$<$value$>$}
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \texttt{$<$algorithm-2-env-1$>$}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{$<$a-hyperparameter$>$}: \texttt{$<$value$>$}
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \item The code for reproducing these experiments is available at: \texttt{$<$a-link$>$}
    \item The code also includes the tuning process \cmark \xmark
    \item Bundled with the code is an exact version of the original software environment, e.g. a conda environment file with all package versions or a docker image in case some dependencies are not conda installable \cmark \xmark
    \item The following hardware was used in running the experiments:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{$<$n$>$} \texttt{$<$gpu-types$>$}
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
